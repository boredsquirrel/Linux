Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
    intended for use by those authorized to give the public
    permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
    copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
    and conditions of the license they choose before applying
    it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
    applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
    material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
    material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
    licensed material, or material used under an exception or
    limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
    licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
    licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
    the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
    licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
    other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other
    reasons, including because others have copyright or other
    rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
    such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
    Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
    respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
