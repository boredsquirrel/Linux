## Simple Firefox menus

This is a preset built upon [SimpleMenuWizard](https://github.com/stonecrusher/simpleMenuWizard), which is a nice prebuilt CSS.

It removes as many useless (for me) entries of the Firefox right-click menus as possible, to make it a less cluttered experience.

If you like it, share it with others! Making your Firefox more basic is a pretty contradictory "mod", as mods are normally done by people seeking more features.

### Use

1. Open `about:profiles` and find your profile folder, link that folder to a better location.
2. (Delete the folder of profiles you dont use)
3. In your profile folder create a folder named "chrome" (yes this is a Firefox term for "Browser interface", Google copied it)
4. Download this folder here, so that the `UserChrome.css` is in that folder.
5. In your browser, search for `about:config`
6. Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to true
7. Restart your Browser
