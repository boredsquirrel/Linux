## Simple Firefox Menus

This is a preset built upon [SimpleMenuWizard](https://github.com/stonecrusher/simpleMenuWizard), a well-crafted prebuilt CSS.

It removes as many unnecessary entries from the Firefox right-click menus as possible, making for a cleaner, less cluttered experience.

If you like it, share it with others! Simplifying Firefox is a bit of a paradoxical "mod," as mods are usually created by people looking for more features.

### How to Use

1. Open `about:profiles` in Firefox and locate your profile folder. Link that folder to a more accessible location if needed.
2. (Delete the folders of profiles you don't use.)
3. In your profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (Yes, in Firefox, "chrome" refers to the browser interfaceâ€”Google copied this term.)
4. Download this folder here, ensuring that `UserChrome.css` is placed inside the `chrome` folder.
5. In your browser, go to `about:config`.
6. Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.
7. Restart your browser.
