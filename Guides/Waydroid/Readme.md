# Waydroid

Also note, that Android uses SELinux as a core part of it's sandboxing. Only
distros with SELinux enabled (like Fedora, CentOS, Enterprise Linux) can make
this work at all.

Still, Waydroid drastically reduces the security benefits of Android.

Instead, running a system like [BlissOS](https://blissos.org/) in a Virtual
Machine is less insecure, but their latest version "Zenith" is Android 13 and
probably unstable.

The project seems to be a successor to Waydroid in part.

It is critical that the "Linux on Phones" community relies on Waydroid so much.
