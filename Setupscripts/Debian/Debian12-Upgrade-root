------ Debian Updater script

Preperation:
- The updates should work completely normal
- If you want to be sure, do a backup of all your files and more importantly App configs
- To do the update, you need to upgrade your packages to the latest version supported by the current release
- 3rd Party repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ will probably break the update. Remove the old repo and add the new repo after doing your upgrades.
